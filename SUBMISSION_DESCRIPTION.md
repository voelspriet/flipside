**FlipSide — The dark side of small print.**

Every contract has two sides. You've only seen one.

FlipSide reads any document you didn't write — leases, insurance policies, gym memberships, terms of service — and shows you what the drafter intended. Upload a document. Browse flip cards: the front shows what the drafter wants you to feel. Flip it to see what an expert catches. Risk scores, trick classifications, concrete dollar figures.

Split-model architecture: Haiku 4.5 generates flip cards in parallel (~8 seconds), while Opus 4.6 builds an expert verdict with jurisdiction detection, power ratio analysis, and a negotiation playbook. Follow-up questions are powered by the Claude Agent SDK — an Opus 4.6 agent with document search tools autonomously traces answers through every relevant clause.

14 built-in sample documents. 6 input formats. 18-type trick taxonomy. $0.54 per analysis.

Built entirely through conversation with Claude Code by a journalist with zero coding experience. 13,829 lines. 83 commits. 5 days. The flip card makes legal analysis feel human — not legal advice, legal awareness. For everyone.
