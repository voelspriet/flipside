**FlipSide — The dark side of small print.**

Gym memberships, app terms, pet adoptions, sweepstakes entries — the things you sign with a shrug. They weren't written with one.

Built entirely through conversation with Claude Code by a non-coder. 14,600+ lines. 89 commits. 5 days.

FlipSide reads any document you didn't write and shows you what the drafter intended. Upload a PDF, paste a URL, or try one of 14 built-in samples. Browse flip cards: the front shows what the drafter wants you to feel. Flip it to see what an expert catches. Risk scores, trick classifications, concrete dollar figures.

Haiku 4.5 builds flip cards in seconds. Opus 4.6 builds the expert verdict in the background — jurisdiction detection, power ratio, risk checklist. Follow-up questions use Opus 4.6 with document search tools, autonomously tracing answers through every relevant clause.

6 input formats. 18-type trick taxonomy. The flip card makes legal analysis feel human — not legal advice, legal awareness. For everyone.
