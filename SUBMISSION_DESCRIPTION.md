**FlipSide — The dark side of small print.**

  Every contract has a drafter. The drafter wrote it for a reason. FlipSide   
  shows you that reason.                                                      
                                                                              
  Upload any document you didn't write — gym membership, coupon, app terms,   
  employment contract, insurance policy — or try one of 14 built-in samples.  
  FlipSide treats a $2 coupon with the same seriousness as a $500,000
  corporate lease. Browse flip cards: the front shows what the drafter wants
  you to feel. Flip it to see what an expert catches. Risk scores, trick
  classifications, concrete dollar figures.

  Why Opus 4.6? Haiku 4.5 builds the flip cards — fast, structured, parallel.
  But the verdict requires what only Opus delivers: cross-clause reasoning
  that connects a liability waiver on page 2 to an arbitration clause on page
  8, and theory of mind that reconstructs the drafter's intent from the
  language they chose.

  Millions of people sign one-sided documents every year without understanding
   the other side. FlipSide makes legal awareness free and human — not legal
  advice, but the other side of the story.
