**FlipSide — The dark side of small print.**

Gym memberships, app terms, pet adoptions, sweepstakes entries — the things you sign with a shrug. They weren't written with one. FlipSide treats a $2 coupon with the same seriousness as a $500,000 corporate lease. The tricks are the same — only the stakes change. Existing tools in legal tech — Lawgeex and LegalZoom — target lawyers and legal teams. Try finding one that handles gym memberships, coupons, or sweepstakes.

Upload any document you didn't write — or try one of 14 built-in samples. Browse flip cards: the front shows what the drafter wants you to feel. Flip it to see what an expert catches. Risk scores, trick classifications, concrete dollar figures.

Why Opus 4.6? Haiku 4.5 builds the flip cards — fast, structured, parallel. But the verdict requires what only Opus delivers: cross-clause reasoning that connects a liability waiver on page 2 to an arbitration clause on page 8, and theory of mind that reconstructs the drafter's intent from the language they chose.

Millions of people sign one-sided documents every year without seeing the other side. Now they can.
