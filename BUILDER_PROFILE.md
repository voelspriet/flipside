## Background

I train investigative teams at BBC, NYT, and Reuters. My methodology — "Think Like a Document" — means: read from the drafter's perspective, not yours. FlipSide applies that to legal documents.

Assessor for IFCN (Poynter) and EFCSN. Early Bellingcat contributor. Author of the [Reporter's Guide to Detecting AI-Generated Content](https://gijn.org/resource/guide-detecting-ai-generated-content/) (GIJN).

**Newsletter**: 10,000+ subscribers from BBC, NYT, Reuters, Amnesty, Europol, UN, Harvard, MIT, NATO, Interpol.
