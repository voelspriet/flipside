## Why FlipSide Comes From This Builder

I've spent 20 years teaching investigators how to find what's hidden in plain sight. FlipSide does the same thing for contracts.

I train investigative teams at BBC, NYT, and Reuters to find hidden information. My methodology — "Think Like a Document" — was published at CHI 2026 (ACM). FlipSide applies it to contracts: read from the drafter's perspective, not yours.

This is not an abstract idea. It comes from decades of training investigators to find documents they couldn't find, verify claims they couldn't verify, and see what was hidden in plain sight. FlipSide is the same thinking applied to legal documents.
