## CRITICAL CORRECTION: Thariq Shihipar

**The original analysis incorrectly linked Thariq to Upsolve.** Upsolve was founded by Rohan Pavluri, Jonathan Petts, and Mark Hansen. Thariq has NO connection to Upsolve.

### Thariq's Actual Background

| Detail | Source | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Serial entrepreneur — founded **One More Multiverse** (YC gaming company, raised $17M, 1M+ users, viral on TikTok) | [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/thariq-s), [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| Co-founded **Chime** during undergrad — acquired by **HubSpot** in 2013 | [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| Built **Edgeout.gg** (gaming analytics) — sold to **Blitz.gg** | [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| Co-founded **PubPub.org** — open-source academic publishing platform (nonprofit) | [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| **MIT Media Lab** — Master's degree (2014-2016) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ThariqS) | [HIGH] |
| Built AI tools: **LatentLit** (LLM agents), **Quick Edit** (AI copyediting), **Sherpa** (email agent) | [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| Works on **Claude Code** at Anthropic as MTS | [thariq.io](https://www.thariq.io/) | [HIGH] |
| Blog topics: **spirituality & philosophy** alongside AI/interpretability | [thariq.io/blog](https://www.thariq.io/blog) | [HIGH] |
| Wrote about Claude Computer Use, LLM uncertainty detection, developer interpretability | [thariq.io/blog](https://www.thariq.io/blog) | [HIGH] |

### What This Changes About the Analysis

- **Remove:** The entire "social impact / civic tech" angle attributed to Thariq
- **Replace with:** Serial entrepreneur who values **creative product-building, gaming, AI agent design, and philosophical depth**
- **He'll resonate with:** Novel AI agent architectures, creative product ideas, anything with a "builder" mentality. His gaming background means he appreciates engaging UX.
- **He'll NOT particularly resonate with:** Social justice framing (that was based on the wrong person). He's an entrepreneur and deep thinker, not an activist.

## Boris Cherny — Enhanced Profile

Source: [Developing Dev interview](https://www.developing.dev/p/boris-cherny-creator-of-claude-code), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/29/100-percent-of-code-at-anthropic-and-openai-is-now-ai-written-boris-cherny-roon/), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are)

### New Findings [HIGH confidence]

- **Self-taught programmer.** Did not study CS. Started startups at age 18, learned coding practically. Rose from mid-level engineer to **IC8 Principal at Meta**.
- **Values generalist engineers** who code AND do product work, design, and have product sense. He actively recruited for this at Anthropic.
- **"Latent demand" principle:** Understanding what users actually need matters more than what they ask for. Real product insights come from observing behavior.
- **100% of his code is now written by Claude.** Quote: "For me personally, it has been 100% for two+ months now, I don't even make small edits by hand."
- **Prefers Opus with thinking** over Sonnet — values quality and reliability over speed.
- **Claude Code is ~80-90% written by itself.** Anthropic productivity per engineer grew ~70% despite tripling headcount.
- **"Build for the model six months from now"** — his manager's advice. Don't build for current limitations.
- **Side quests are growth:** "If you hit the same problem two or three times, you should probably look around, see if other people are hitting that problem too."
- **Automates repeated problems:** Tracked code review issues in a spreadsheet, then wrote lint rules, eventually automating most reviews.
- **Mission-driven:** "I wanted to be at a place where, in the tiniest way, I can make sure this goes well" (re: AI safety).
- **No formal titles:** Advocates for environments where you "have to earn it" regardless of past accomplishments.
- **Future vision:** Orchestrating multiple Claude instances rather than manual coding. Example: "she had a swarm of 20 Claudes build plugins over the weekend."

### What This Means for Us

Boris will be most impressed by:
1. **Agentic orchestration** — not just one Claude call, but systems of Claude instances working together
2. **Generalist thinking** — product sense + engineering combined
3. **Building for latent demand** — solving a problem people didn't know they had
4. **Evidence of automation** — "I saw this problem, I built a system to solve it"

## Cat Wu — Enhanced Profile

### New Findings [HIGH confidence]

- **Product Lead specifically for Claude Code** — not a general Anthropic PM. She owns the product strategy for the exact tool this hackathon centers on.
- **Briefly left Anthropic for Cursor** (Anysphere) as Head of Product, then **returned after just 2 weeks**. This shows deep personal investment in Claude Code.
- **"Prototypes over documentation"** — her team skips Google Docs. Quote: "The source of truth is the code base."
- **Engineer-led feature development:** "Many of our best features came from an engineer prototyping an idea and shipping it to internal users."
- **Rapid feedback loops:** Gathers user feedback every 10 minutes from 1,000+ users.
- **Cross-functional:** Values designers and PMs who write production code.
- **Emphasizes Claude.md files** for giving AI systems project context.
- **Organic validation:** If internal users begin naturally using a feature, it indicates genuine value. No formal launch needed.

### What This Means for Us

Cat will be most impressed by:
1. **A working prototype** — she literally values prototypes over documentation
2. **Evidence that real users would adopt it** — organic "pull" over forced "push"
3. **Good use of Claude.md / CLAUDE.md** — she specifically values this pattern
4. **Cross-functional craft** — showing both product thinking AND engineering

## Ado Kukic — Confirmed & Enhanced

Source: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kukicado/), [adocomplete.com](https://adocomplete.com/), [Auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/ado-kukic/)

### Confirmed [HIGH confidence]

- Auth0 (Developer Evangelist Lead), MongoDB, DigitalOcean (Director of Developer Advocacy), Sourcegraph — all confirmed
- 20+ years building on the web
- QCon speaker
- Recent LinkedIn post: excited about **Anthropic API web fetch tool for developers**
- Personal site: adocomplete.com

### Addition

- His LinkedIn post about web fetch tool shows he's **actively excited about new API features** — if we use a recently-released Claude capability, he'll notice and appreciate it.

## Jason Bigman — Enhanced Profile

Source: [Gray Area](https://grayarea.org/community-entry/jason-bigman/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-bigman-a134a024/)

### New Findings [HIGH confidence]

- Previously **Director of Community at Reddit** — overseeing partnerships with volunteer moderators
- Also worked at **Facebook, Coinbase, and Coursera**
- **Speaks NINE languages.** Has lived in **10+ countries.**
- Connected to **Gray Area** — an art/technology nonprofit in San Francisco
- Focus: community management, product, and **internationalization**
- Lives in Oakland, CA

### What This Means for Us

Jason will be most impressed by:
1. **Global/multilingual angles** — a man who speaks 9 languages notices when tools break language barriers
2. **Community-ready projects** — his Reddit background means he thinks about scale, moderation, and community health
3. **Art/tech intersection** — Gray Area connection suggests he appreciates creative technology
4. **"Feature story" quality** — from Reddit/Facebook/Coinbase he's written countless community announcements. He wants a project that writes its own press release.

## Revised Jury Overlap Matrix

| Theme | Boris | Cat | Thariq | Ado | Jason | Count |
|-------|:-----:|:---:|:------:|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Uses Claude's unique capabilities** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **5/5** |
| **Working prototype over documentation** | YES | YES | YES | YES | -- | **4/5** |
| **Creative/novel AI agent use** | YES | -- | YES | YES | -- | **3/5** |
| **Clear product/user story** | yes | YES | yes | YES | YES | **4/5** |
| **Builder/maker mentality** | YES | YES | YES | yes | -- | **4/5** |
| **Could inspire the developer community** | yes | -- | yes | YES | YES | **3/5** |
| ~~Social impact / civic tech~~ | -- | -- | ~~NO~~ | -- | -- | **REMOVED** |
| **Gaming / engaging UX** | -- | -- | YES | -- | yes | **2/5** |
| **Multilingual / global reach** | -- | -- | -- | -- | YES | **1/5** |

### Key Change: The "Social Impact" Row Is Gone

The original analysis had a 3/5 overlap on social impact, driven primarily by the (incorrect) Thariq-Upsolve connection. With that removed, social impact drops to a **nice-to-have, not a strategic target**. The jury is primarily:

- **Builders** (Boris, Cat, Thariq — all ship products)
- **Community amplifiers** (Ado, Jason — make things visible)

---

## Updated Sweet Spot

```
The winning project:
  An AGENTIC tool (Boris, Thariq)
  that WORKS as a prototype (Cat)
  solving a REAL problem (all 5)
  built with CRAFT (Boris, Cat)
  that's TEACHABLE and community-ready (Ado, Jason)
  and shows CREATIVE use of Opus 4.6 (all 5)
```

The social impact angle is no longer a primary strategic play. Instead, focus on the **builder-entrepreneur** mindset that Boris, Cat, and Thariq all share: ship something real, iterate fast, and show craft.
