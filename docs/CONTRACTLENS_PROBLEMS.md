# ContractLens: 10 Real Problems with One-Sided Documents

> Generated 2026-02-10. Based on the ContractLens concept as defined in EXPANDED_REACH.md and TOOL_CONCEPTS.md. No features beyond those documents are proposed.

## 1. Ten Specific Problems

### Problem 1: The Freelancer's Non-Compete Trap

- **User**: Freelance software developer
- **What happens now**: They sign a client's contract without realizing a broadly worded non-compete clause prevents them from working for any company in the same industry for 18 months after the engagement ends, effectively killing their livelihood.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the client's attorney, the tool reveals that "competitive activity" is defined so broadly it covers the freelancer's entire skill set, and that the geographic scope ("worldwide") and time period (18 months) are designed to maximize the client's protection at the freelancer's expense.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~10,000,000 (freelancers globally who sign client contracts each year)

### Problem 2: The Tenant's Hidden Maintenance Burden

- **User**: Apartment tenant
- **What happens now**: They sign a lease that appears standard but contains a clause shifting all non-structural repair costs to the tenant, and they discover this only when their landlord refuses to fix a broken heating system in January.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the landlord's attorney, the tool flags that "repairs not covered by building insurance" effectively means the tenant pays for plumbing, electrical, appliances, and HVAC, because building insurance typically covers only structural damage and natural disasters.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~15,000,000 (tenants signing or renewing leases annually in the US and EU combined)

### Problem 3: The App User's Data Surrender

- **User**: Consumer installing a mobile app
- **What happens now**: They tap "I Agree" on a terms of service they never read, granting the app permission to collect location data, sell behavioral profiles to third parties, and retain all user-generated content indefinitely -- with no practical way to revoke consent.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the company's legal team, the tool reveals that the ToS is structured to obtain the broadest possible data license while making opt-out technically possible but practically invisible, and that the "we may share with partners" clause means unrestricted sale to data brokers.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~200,000,000 (English/Dutch/German-speaking users who accept ToS on new apps or updated terms each year)

### Problem 4: The Policyholder's Exclusion Maze

- **User**: Homeowner with an insurance policy
- **What happens now**: They believe they are covered for water damage, but when a pipe bursts, the insurer denies the claim citing an exclusion for "gradual seepage" buried in a sub-clause, and the policyholder has no basis to dispute it because they never understood the exclusion structure.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the insurer's underwriter, the tool reveals that the policy's coverage section is written broadly to create a feeling of protection, while the exclusions section systematically narrows that coverage through layered sub-clauses that interact to deny the most common real-world claims.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~30,000,000 (homeowners and renters who hold or renew insurance policies annually in the US and EU)

### Problem 5: The Employee's At-Will Illusion

- **User**: New employee at a mid-size company
- **What happens now**: They sign an employee handbook acknowledgment believing it describes mutual commitments, but the handbook contains an at-will clause that renders every other promise (progressive discipline, severance, promotion criteria) legally unenforceable, and an arbitration clause that prevents them from joining a class action.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the company's HR counsel, the tool reveals that the handbook is structured to create the appearance of job security and process while the at-will and arbitration clauses preserve the employer's unilateral power to terminate and prevent collective legal action.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~20,000,000 (employees who start new jobs or sign updated handbook acknowledgments annually in the US alone)

### Problem 6: The Borrower's Penalty Stack

- **User**: Consumer taking a personal or auto loan
- **What happens now**: They compare interest rates across lenders but do not analyze the penalty clauses, and later discover that a single late payment triggers a default interest rate, acceleration of the full balance, and fees that compound -- turning a $300 missed payment into a $3,000 problem.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the lender's counsel, the tool reveals that the penalty clauses are designed to stack: each trigger activates the next, and the "cure period" is deliberately short (5 days) to maximize the probability that a borrower who misses one payment also triggers the cascade.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~25,000,000 (consumers who take new loans or refinance annually in the US and EU)

### Problem 7: The HOA Homeowner's Rule Ratchet

- **User**: Homeowner in a homeowners association
- **What happens now**: They buy a home knowing the HOA has "some rules" but do not read the CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions), and later face fines for landscaping choices, rental restrictions that prevent them from listing on Airbnb, or special assessments they cannot vote down.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the HOA board's attorney, the tool reveals that the CC&Rs grant the board unilateral authority to amend rules, levy assessments, and impose fines, with cure periods and appeal processes designed to favor the board's position and make challenges prohibitively expensive for individual homeowners.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~5,000,000 (homeowners who buy into or are subject to updated HOA rules annually in the US)

### Problem 8: The Small Business Owner's Vendor Lock-In

- **User**: Small business owner signing a SaaS or vendor contract
- **What happens now**: They sign a vendor agreement focused on the monthly price and features, missing an auto-renewal clause with a 60-day cancellation window and a data portability provision that charges per-record export fees, effectively making it costly and complex to leave.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the vendor's legal team, the tool reveals that the contract is structured to minimize acquisition friction (easy sign-up, flexible first term) while maximizing retention friction (narrow cancellation windows, data hostage provisions, steep early-termination fees).
- **Estimated annual users**: ~10,000,000 (small business owners who sign vendor or SaaS contracts annually globally)

### Problem 9: The Independent Contractor's Liability Exposure

- **User**: Independent contractor (consultant, photographer, event planner)
- **What happens now**: They sign a client's service agreement that includes a broad indemnification clause requiring the contractor to cover the client's losses "arising from or related to" the contractor's work, which -- when combined with a limitation-of-liability clause that caps the client's exposure but not the contractor's -- creates unlimited personal financial risk.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the client's attorney, the tool reveals that the indemnification is one-directional (contractor indemnifies client, but not vice versa), that "arising from or related to" is the broadest possible causal language, and that the limitation-of-liability clause protects only the client, creating an asymmetry where the contractor bears uncapped risk for capped pay.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~8,000,000 (independent contractors who sign client service agreements annually in the US and EU)

### Problem 10: The Patient's Consent Form Waiver

- **User**: Medical patient at a private clinic or elective procedure facility
- **What happens now**: They sign a consent form in the waiting room moments before a procedure, believing it is a standard medical formality, without realizing it contains a binding arbitration clause and a broad liability waiver that limits their legal recourse if something goes wrong.
- **What ContractLens shows them**: By thinking like the clinic's legal counsel, the tool reveals that the consent form bundles genuine informed medical consent with legal liability protections for the facility, and that the arbitration clause and liability waiver are strategically placed after the medical disclosures to benefit from the patient's assumption that everything on the form is standard medical procedure.
- **Estimated annual users**: ~15,000,000 (patients who sign consent forms at private or elective-care facilities annually in the US)

## 3. Three Lists

### 3a. Most Users Affected Annually

| Rank | Problem | Estimated Users |
|------|---------|:--------------:|
| 1 | #3 App User's Data Surrender | ~200,000,000 |
| 2 | #4 Policyholder's Exclusion Maze | ~30,000,000 |
| 3 | #6 Borrower's Penalty Stack | ~25,000,000 |

### 3b. Most Financial Damage Per Incident

| Rank | Problem | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | #4 Policyholder's Exclusion Maze | A denied homeowner insurance claim averages $10,000-$50,000+ per incident (full cost of water/fire damage borne by the policyholder). |
| 2 | #6 Borrower's Penalty Stack | A triggered penalty cascade on a loan can add $3,000-$15,000 in default interest, fees, and accelerated balance on top of the original missed payment. |
| 3 | #9 Contractor's Liability Exposure | An uncapped indemnification claim against an independent contractor can reach $50,000-$500,000+, potentially bankrupting the individual. |

### 3c. Least Served by Existing Tools

| Rank | Problem | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | #4 Policyholder's Exclusion Maze | No consumer tool analyzes insurance policies from the underwriter's strategic perspective. Existing "policy comparison" tools compare premiums and coverage summaries, not exclusion structures. The interaction between coverage grants and exclusion sub-clauses is invisible to current tools. |
| 2 | #7 HOA Rule Ratchet | No tool analyzes CC&Rs from the board attorney's perspective. HOA documents are rarely reviewed by any service because they are neither standard contracts nor consumer agreements -- they fall between categories. |
| 3 | #5 Employee's At-Will Illusion | No tool analyzes employee handbooks adversarially. HR tech tools help employers draft handbooks; nothing helps employees understand the strategic function of handbook clauses. The handbook is treated as informational, not contractual, so contract-review tools ignore it. |

## 4. The Single Problem That Appears in 2+ Lists

Counting appearances across the three lists:

| Problem | Appears in 3a (most users) | Appears in 3b (most damage) | Appears in 3c (least served) | Total |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| #3 App User's Data Surrender | Yes | -- | -- | 1 |
| **#4 Policyholder's Exclusion Maze** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **3** |
| #5 Employee's At-Will Illusion | -- | -- | Yes | 1 |
| **#6 Borrower's Penalty Stack** | **Yes** | **Yes** | -- | **2** |
| #7 HOA Rule Ratchet | -- | -- | Yes | 1 |
| #9 Contractor's Liability Exposure | -- | Yes | -- | 1 |

**Problem #4 -- The Policyholder's Exclusion Maze** appears in all three lists: it affects ~30,000,000 users annually (2nd in user count), causes the highest per-incident financial damage ($10,000-$50,000+), and is the least served by existing tools.

Problem #6 also appears in two lists, but #4 ranks higher on user count (30M vs. 25M).

**The single problem is: The Policyholder's Exclusion Maze.**

## 5. Deep Dive: The Policyholder's Exclusion Maze

### The User's Current Workflow (Without ContractLens)

1. **Shop and compare**: The homeowner compares insurance policies online or with an agent, focusing on premium price, deductible amount, and headline coverage categories (fire, water, theft). The exclusions section is not compared because it is dense, jargon-heavy, and presented only in the full policy document that arrives after purchase.

2. **Receive the policy**: After purchase, the full policy document (40-80 pages) arrives by mail or email. The homeowner files it without reading it, or skims the declarations page (which summarizes coverage amounts but not exclusions).

3. **Experience an incident**: A pipe bursts, a tree falls on the roof, or mold is discovered. The homeowner calls the insurer to file a claim, confident they are covered because "water damage" or "storm damage" is listed on their declarations page.

4. **Receive a denial or partial payment**: The claims adjuster cites a specific exclusion (e.g., "gradual seepage," "lack of maintenance," "earth movement") that the homeowner has never read. The denial letter references clause numbers in the policy the homeowner never opened.

5. **Attempt to dispute without leverage**: The homeowner re-reads the policy for the first time, cannot parse the exclusion structure, and either accepts the denial, hires a public adjuster ($500-$2,000), or hires an attorney ($300-$500/hour) -- often spending thousands to dispute a claim, with no guarantee of success.

### Where ContractLens Intervenes

ContractLens intervenes at **Step 2** -- the moment the homeowner receives the full policy document but before any incident occurs. Instead of filing the policy unread, the homeowner uploads it to ContractLens.

This is the only point where the information asymmetry can be corrected proactively. At Step 1 the full policy is not yet available. At Steps 3-5 the damage is already done.

### What the User Sees on Screen at Each Step

**Step 1: Upload and role selection**

The homeowner opens ContractLens and sees:
- A document upload area (drag-and-drop or paste) at center screen.
- A role selector at the top bar: "I am the: Freelancer / Tenant / Contractor / Employee / **App User / Policyholder** / Borrower / Homeowner / Other." They select **Policyholder**.
- A toggle: "Can you negotiate this document? **[Yes / No]**." They select **No** (insurance policies are non-negotiable after purchase).

They upload the 60-page homeowner's insurance policy PDF.

**Step 2: Streaming adversarial analysis**

The center panel begins streaming Opus 4.6's extended thinking chain. The homeowner sees the model reasoning from the insurer's perspective in real time:

> *"I am now thinking like the insurance company's underwriting counsel who drafted this policy."*
>
> *"Section 1 (Coverage A - Dwelling) grants broad coverage for 'direct physical loss' to the structure. This sounds comprehensive. But from the insurer's perspective, the strategic value of this broad grant is that it creates a feeling of total protection that makes the policyholder less likely to scrutinize the exclusions."*
>
> *"Section 2 (Exclusions) contains 14 exclusion categories. From the insurer's perspective, exclusions 2(c) through 2(f) interact: 'water damage' is covered under Section 1 but excluded under 2(c) if it results from 'gradual seepage, leakage, or influx of water over a period of 14 days or more.' The insurer knows that most residential water damage IS gradual -- a slow pipe leak, condensation, foundation seepage. The 14-day threshold means almost any water claim can be reclassified as 'gradual' after the fact."*
>
> *"Exclusion 2(e) excludes 'damage caused by lack of maintenance.' From the insurer's perspective, this is the fallback exclusion: if 2(c) does not apply, the insurer can argue the homeowner should have maintained the pipe/roof/gutter, shifting the burden to the policyholder to prove they maintained their home -- which most homeowners cannot document."*

The left panel shows the policy text, with clauses color-coded as they are analyzed:
- **Green** for standard boilerplate (declarations page, definitions).
- **Yellow** for clauses that are notable (broad coverage grants that create expectations).
- **Red** for significantly asymmetric clauses (the exclusion sub-clauses and their interactions).

**Step 3: Risk summary and action options**

The right panel populates as the analysis completes. Because the homeowner selected "No" on the negotiation toggle, the right panel shows **"Action Options"** instead of "Suggested revisions." The homeowner sees:

> **Risk Flag #1 (High): Water damage exclusion interaction**
> Clauses 2(c) and 2(e) together mean that most real-world water damage claims can be denied. Clause 2(c) excludes gradual water damage. Clause 2(e) excludes damage from lack of maintenance. Together, they give the insurer two independent grounds to deny most water claims.
>
> *What this means for you*: If a pipe leaks slowly and causes damage, the insurer will likely deny the claim under 2(c). If you argue the leak was sudden, the insurer may invoke 2(e) and ask for maintenance records.
>
> *What to watch for*: Document all home maintenance (plumbing inspections, gutter cleaning) with dated receipts. If a water incident occurs, report it immediately -- delay strengthens the insurer's "gradual seepage" argument.

> **Risk Flag #2 (High): Mold exclusion**
> Clause 2(h) excludes mold regardless of cause. From the insurer's perspective, mold is the most common secondary consequence of water damage. By excluding mold categorically, the insurer limits its payout even on water claims it does cover.
>
> *What this means for you*: Even if a sudden pipe burst is covered, the mold that develops in the following weeks is not. The covered water event may result in $5,000 of damage; the excluded mold may cost $20,000 to remediate.
>
> *Alternative services without this clause*: Some insurers offer mold coverage as a paid endorsement. [This is noted but no specific insurers are recommended -- the tool does not make product recommendations.]

> **Risk Flag #3 (Medium): Arbitration clause in Section 9**
> Clause 9.4 requires binding arbitration for disputes over claim denials. From the insurer's perspective, arbitration is faster and less expensive than litigation, and arbitration outcomes are not publicly reported -- meaning patterns of denied claims remain invisible to regulators and other policyholders.
>
> *What this means for you*: If you dispute a claim denial, you cannot sue in court. Arbitration limits discovery (the insurer does not have to disclose its claims denial history) and the decision is final.

The homeowner now has, for the first time, a clear understanding of what their policy strategically does not cover and why the exclusions are structured the way they are. They can take the specific action steps (documenting maintenance, understanding which damage types are excluded) before any incident occurs.
