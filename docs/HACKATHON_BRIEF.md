## Problem Statements

### 1. Build a Tool That Should Exist
Create the AI-native app or workflow you wish someone had already built. Eliminate busywork. Make hard things effortless.

### 2. Break the Barriers
Take something powerful locked behind expertise, cost, language, or infrastructure and put it in everyone's hands.

### 3. Amplify Human Judgment
Build AI that makes researchers, professionals, and decision-makers dramatically more capable — without taking them out of the loop.

| **Opus 4.6 Use** | **25%** | Creative use, beyond basic integration, capabilities that surprised even Anthropic |
| **Depth & Execution** | **20%** | Pushed past first idea, sound engineering, real craft not quick hack |
