# FlipSide

**The dark side of small print.**

> What did you agree to? Upload a document you didn't write. See what the other side intended.

---

## The Problem

Every day, millions of people accept documents they did not draft and do not fully understand. Not just contracts — sweepstakes rules, coupon booklets, gym memberships, pet adoption papers, wedding venue agreements, timeshare packages, insurance policies, app Terms of Service.

These documents are written by one party's legal team, marketing department, or compliance office to protect *that party's* interests. The person signing — or clicking "I Agree" — sees the words. They do not see the strategy behind the words.

There is no tool that shows you what a document looks like from the other side — from the perspective of the party who drafted it.

---

## What FlipSide Does

You upload any document someone else wrote for you to sign, accept, or agree to. FlipSide reads it as if it were the drafter's attorney — the person who wrote it and knows exactly why every clause is there. Then it tells you what it found.

**One input. One perspective flip. One output.**

### The Four Steps

1. **Upload** — Drag in a PDF, DOCX, paste text, or pick a sample. FlipSide handles everything from a one-page gym contract to a 40-page insurance policy.

2. **Browse flip cards** — Cards appear one at a time within seconds. Each card is a clause with two sides:

   * **Front**: A calm green header with a reassurance headline ("Your flexible payment timeline") followed by the reader's gullible first impression. This is how the drafter WANTS you to feel. Navigation is hidden until you flip your first card — forcing the core mechanic.
   * **Back**: What the drafter intended — risk score, trick classification, the key figure in bold ("$4,100 in penalties"), a concrete scenario, and bottom-line action. The sidebar dims to 35% opacity to spotlight the reveal.
   * **Confidence badge**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with reasoned explanation
   * **Color-coded**: Green (genuinely fair) · Yellow (notable) · Red (strategically asymmetric)
   * **Document preview**: Sidebar shows the full text with numbered clause markers (①②③) that highlight as you navigate cards
   * All output in English regardless of document language. Download the full report translated to the document's original language.

3. **Read the Expert Verdict** — While you browse cards, 4 parallel Opus 4.6 threads build the expert verdict in the right column:

   * **Cross-clause interactions** — compound risks invisible when reading clause by clause, with villain voice and YOUR MOVE actions
   * **Power Asymmetry & Fair Standard** — obligation count per party, power ratio, how the worst clauses compare to industry norms
   * **Document Archaeology & Drafter Profile** — boilerplate vs. custom clauses, who drafted this and what it signals
   * **Overall Assessment** — risk score, methodology disclosure, quality check where Opus reviews its own analysis for blind spots

4. **Take action** — After the verdict:

   * **Ask follow-up questions** — "What happens if I'm 3 months late on rent?" / "Which clauses can I negotiate?" — Opus traces the answer through all relevant clauses
   * **Message the company** — One-click draft of a professional letter citing the specific high-risk clauses, ready to copy or email
   * **Counter-draft** — Opus rewrites unfair clauses with negotiable alternatives you can propose
   * **Download report** — Export the full analysis, optionally translated to the document's original language

## 14 Opus 4.6 Capabilities in One Product

FlipSide uses more Opus 4.6 capabilities than any single feature would require — including five that Anthropic [specifically highlights in the Opus 4.6 announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introducing-claude-opus-4-6): adaptive thinking, long-context retrieval, low over-refusals, effort controls, and context compaction. Each capability is **visible in the product** — not a behind-the-scenes optimization.

| # | Opus 4.6 Feature | What the user sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Adaptive thinking** | 4 parallel Opus threads each decide their own reasoning depth — more on complex interactions, less on boilerplate |
| 2 | **Long-context retrieval** | Cross-clause interaction detection across the full document. Clause 2(c) and Clause 2(e) together deny water claims — neither is dangerous alone |
| 3 | **Low over-refusals** | Villain voice — adversarial role-play where Opus adopts the drafter's perspective. Previous models would self-censor. Opus 4.6 fully commits |
| 4 | **Effort controls** | Architecture maps depth selector to Opus 4.6's `effort` parameter. Currently using `max_tokens` as depth knob pending SDK support |
| 5 | **Context compaction** | Follow-up questions send full document + analysis as context. Compaction enables extended Q&A without hitting the context window |
| 6 | **Vision / multimodal** | PDF pages sent as images — Opus detects fine print, buried placement, visual hierarchy tricks invisible to text extraction |
| 7 | **Tool use** | `assess_risk` and `flag_interaction` tools structure findings with risk level, confidence %, trick type |
| 8 | **Confidence calibration** | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW badges with explicit reasoning chains — not pattern-matched, but thought through |
| 9 | **Self-correction** | Quality Check — Opus reviews its own analysis for false positives and blind spots before presenting results |
| 10 | **Split-model parallel** | Haiku 4.5 (instant full cards) + 4× Opus 4.6 (expert verdict threads) — 5 threads at t=0 |
| 11 | **Prompt caching** | System prompts cached server-side for 90% cost reduction on repeated analyses |
| 12 | **Counterfactual generation** | Fair Standard Comparison + Counter-draft: worst clauses measured against norms, then rewritten with fair alternatives |
| 13 | **Stylistic deduction** | Document Archaeology — boilerplate vs. custom clauses, drafter profile from writing patterns |
| 14 | **English-only + download in language** | All output in English for universal access. Download full report translated to the document's original language |

### Why Opus 4.6 Specifically

Five capabilities from [Anthropic's Opus 4.6 announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introducing-claude-opus-4-6) are **structurally necessary** for FlipSide to work. Remove any one and the product degrades:

1. **Adaptive thinking — the reasoning IS the product.** Each of 4 parallel Opus threads decides its own reasoning depth: spending more thinking tokens on complex interactions and less on standard boilerplate. Most projects use extended thinking as a black box. FlipSide makes it visible in the expert verdict.

2. **Long-context retrieval — finding legal traps spread across pages.** Anthropic reports "76% on MRCR v2 8-needle 1M — a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use." FlipSide applies this to cross-clause interaction detection: Clause 2(c) excludes water damage from "gradual seepage over 14 days." Clause 2(e) defines the inspection timeline at 30 days. Neither clause is dangerous alone. Together, they deny virtually all residential water damage claims.

3. **Low over-refusals — the villain voice works.** Every red-flagged interaction includes adversarial role-play where Opus adopts the drafter's voice: *"The math does the work. Two weeks late once and you'll never catch up."* Previous models would self-censor, add disclaimers, or refuse entirely. Opus 4.6 fully commits to the perspective flip — the core product mechanic.

4. **Effort controls — user-facing intelligence dial.** The depth selector (Quick/Standard/Deep) maps to Opus 4.6's `effort` parameter (Quick→medium, Standard→high, Deep→max). Architecture ready; currently using `max_tokens` as depth knob pending SDK support. One-line change when available.

5. **Context compaction — follow-up without limits.** After analysis, users ask questions ("What happens if I'm 3 months late?"). Each follow-up sends the full document + previous analysis as context. Compaction enables extended Q&A without hitting the context window.

Plus: **vision** catches formatting tricks text extraction misses, **tool use** structures reasoning into assessable data, and **self-correction** reviews the analysis for false positives before the user sees it.

## The Meta-Prompting Discovery

During the hackathon, we stumbled on something that even the Claude Code team couldn't fully explain.

When you ask Claude to **"analyze this contract"**, you get a decent analysis. But when you ask Claude to **"write a prompt for analyzing this contract"** and then say **"now execute that prompt"** — the results are dramatically better.

Why? The two-step approach forces the model to separate *planning* from *execution*. In the first step, it reasons about what makes a good analysis. In the second step, it follows its own expert framework. It's chain-of-thought at the meta level.

**Cat Wu** (Product Lead and co-creator of Claude Code) confirmed this pattern during the hackathon AMA — the effect is real, though the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.

FlipSide's entire architecture is a **productized version of this discovery**. The system prompt teaches Claude *how to think about documents*: adopt the drafter's perspective, apply a taxonomy of 18 legal trick types (Silent Waiver, Time Trap, Cascade Clause, Phantom Protection, Honey Trap...), contrast "what the small print says" against "what you should read." The prompt is a pre-built reasoning framework that every uploaded document executes against.

The user never sees this meta-prompt. They just see better results.

---

## The Principle

FlipSide applies **"Think Like a Document"** (CHI 2026, Henk van Ess) to a new domain:

| In search | In FlipSide |
| --- | --- |
| Don't search using YOUR words | Don't read using YOUR perspective |
| Think like the document you're looking for | Think like the party who drafted the document |
| The document doesn't know your vocabulary | The contract doesn't serve your interests |
| Match the document's language to find it | Adopt the drafter's perspective to understand it |

The underlying principle is the same: **don't take yourself as the measurement of things. Observe what must be there.**

**Seven-Stage Pipeline**

| Stage | Agent | What It Does | What the User Sees |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Instant Cards | Haiku 4.5 | Full flip cards — both sides | Cards fly in within ~12s. Flip any card instantly. |
| 2. Cross-Clause | Opus 4.6 Thread 1 | Compound risks, villain voice, YOUR MOVE | Verdict column section 1 streams in |
| 3. Asymmetry | Opus 4.6 Thread 2 | Power ratio, fair standard comparison | Verdict column section 2 streams in |
| 4. Archaeology | Opus 4.6 Thread 3 | Boilerplate vs. custom, drafter profile | Verdict column section 3 streams in |
| 5. Overall | Opus 4.6 Thread 4 | Assessment, methodology, quality check | Auto-expands after 1-3 complete |
| 6. Counter-Draft | Opus 4.6 (on demand) | Rewrites unfair clauses with alternatives | Fair-language replacements per clause |
| 7. Follow-up | Opus 4.6 (interactive) | User questions → Opus traces through all clauses | Consultation + message-the-company |

**Key architectural insight:** We originally put Opus 4.6 on the card backs — assuming the flip needed the most powerful model. After 3 hours of DOM rendering failures, we discovered Haiku was already doing a great job on cards. Opus's real value is in the work Haiku *can't* do: cross-clause reasoning, power analysis, archaeological deduction, and self-correction. Each model now has a stage that showcases what it does best. See [strategy.md](strategy.md) for the full decision story.

**Tech stack:** Python/Flask, Server-Sent Events, Anthropic API (Haiku 4.5 + Opus 4.6 with extended thinking, vision, tool use, prompt caching), single-file HTML/CSS/JS frontend, DOMPurify for XSS protection. 14 built-in sample documents with generated thumbnails (including a real Coca-Cola sweepstakes and the real hackathon event waiver). No external APIs beyond Anthropic. No database required. Deployable behind a reverse proxy with URL prefix.

## The Demo Moment

The user picks **"Peace of Mind"** — a homeowner's insurance policy. Cards appear within seconds.

Card front (the naive reader):

> **"Comprehensive coverage for your peace of mind"**
>
> I'D THINK: OK, so my house is covered for "direct physical loss" — that sounds like everything. Water damage, fire, theft. Good. That's exactly what I'm paying for.

The audience nods. That IS what they'd think.

User flips the card.

Card back (the expert analysis):

> **RED** · Score: 82/100 · Trick: **Phantom Protection**
>
> **$0 payout on a $50,000 water damage claim.** Exclusion 2(c) excludes "gradual seepage over 14 days." Clause 2(e) sets the inspection window at 30 days. Together: virtually all residential water damage can be reclassified as "gradual" after the fact. The broad coverage on the front is a psychological anchor — it makes you stop reading before you reach the exclusions that take it away.

Meanwhile, the verdict column fills in: the cross-clause thread has already detected that Clauses 2(c) and 2(e) create a compound trap.

Then the user clicks **"Message the Company"** — and Opus drafts a professional letter citing the specific clauses, ready to copy or email.

## What This Is Not

* Not a legal advice tool (it analyzes documents, it does not give legal recommendations)
* Not a contract generator (it reads existing documents, it does not create new ones)
* Not a diff tool (it reveals strategic intent, not textual differences)
* Not a chatbot (it performs one analysis per document — though you can ask follow-up questions and take action after)

## FlipSide vs. Anthropic's Legal Plugin

On February 2, 2026, Anthropic launched a [legal plugin for Claude Cowork](https://legaltechnology.com/2026/02/03/anthropic-unveils-claude-legal-plugin-and-causes-market-meltdown/) — enterprise contract review that crashed legal tech stocks by $50B+. FlipSide approaches the same domain from the opposite direction. The plugin reviews contracts FOR legal teams. FlipSide reveals what the drafting team intended — for the millions of people who sign documents without a legal team. Same model. Different side of the table.

|  | Anthropic Legal Plugin | FlipSide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | In-house corporate counsel | Anyone who received a document they didn't write |
| **Perspective** | Reviews FROM your configured playbook | Flips TO the drafter's perspective — no playbook needed |
| **Documents** | Contracts your legal team handles | Anything: leases, insurance, ToS, gym memberships, coupon booklets, sweepstakes rules, pet adoption papers |
| **Output** | Redline suggestions, NDA triage | Flip cards, villain voice, YOUR MOVE actions, message-the-company, counter-draft |
| **Requires** | Cowork enterprise license, MCP integrations, configured playbook | Nothing — upload and go. Or pick a sample. |
| **Approach** | Automates what a lawyer already does | Reveals what the lawyer on the other side was thinking |

---

## Problem Statement Fit

**Primary: Break the Barriers**
Legal document analysis is locked behind expertise ($300-500/hour attorneys) and cost. FlipSide puts it in everyone's hands — from a tenant signing a lease to a shopper reading coupon fine print.

**Secondary: Amplify Human Judgment**
FlipSide doesn't replace the user's decision to sign or not sign. It makes them dramatically more informed — human in the loop, but now with the other side's perspective visible.

---

## The Process

This project documents not just the product, but the entire decision-making process — including five documented AI failures and two new methodologies for working with AI:

| Document | What It Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Hackathon Log](HACKATHON_LOG.md) | 73 entries, complete process timeline |
| [Strategy Decisions](strategy.md) | 22 strategy decisions with rationale — including a midpoint self-evaluation |
| [The Prewash Method](docs/PREWASH_METHOD.md) | How to clean bias from AI prompts before execution |
| [Live Demonstration](docs/LIVE_DEMONSTRATION.md) | "Think Like a Document" demonstrated on the AI itself |
| [Prewash Prompt Collection](docs/PREWASH_PROMPT_COLLECTION.md) | 7 real before/after prompt examples |
| [Five AI Failures](docs/ANCHORING_FAILURE.md) | Confirmation bias, framing bias, vocabulary bias, adjective bias, format rigidity — all caught by the human |
| [All docs](docs/) | 18+ methodology and decision documents |

---

## What's Next

* **Browser extension** — Flag Terms of Service on any website before you click "I Agree." The same pipeline, triggered by a single button on any page with legal text.
* **Collaborative review** — Share your analysis with a lawyer or community group via link.
* **Benchmarking** — Compare your lease or insurance policy against anonymized analyses of similar documents. *"Your landlord's late fee clause is harsher than 82% of leases we've seen."*

## Why This Is Open Source

FlipSide is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE) — free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

This project was built entirely with Claude Code by someone who does not write code. Every line — the Flask backend, the SSE streaming architecture, the 5-thread parallel pipeline, the flip card frontend — was written through conversation with Claude Opus 4.6.

That changes who gets to build software. If a journalist with zero programming experience can ship a 5,918-line frontend and a 2,514-line backend in a weekend, then the barrier to building tools is gone. The only barrier left is having something worth building.

This is in the public domain of ideas because the tools that made it possible should produce things that are accessible to everyone. The people who need FlipSide most — tenants, patients, borrowers, app users, shoppers, pet owners, newlyweds — are the same people who could never afford to hire a developer to build it. Now they don't have to.
