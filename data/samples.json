However, if prepayment occurs within the first 24 months, a prepayment penalty of 3% of the remaining principal balance shall apply.

    "filename": "Forever Friends Animal Shelter Adoption Contract (Sample)",
    "text": "FOREVER FRIENDS ANIMAL SHELTER\nADOPTION CONTRACT AND AGREEMENT\n\nShelter Location: 1220 County Road 9, Shelter Building C, Minneapolis, MN 55412\nAnimal ID: FF-2026-03892\nAnimal Name: [Pet Name] — [Breed/Description], approx. [Age]\n\nThis contract is legally binding. Please read all terms before signing.\n\n1. ADOPTION FEE AND INCLUDED SERVICES\n\nAdoption fee of $350 includes initial veterinary exam, age-appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery (or spay/neuter deposit if underage), microchip with registration, and a 14-day health guarantee covering pre-existing conditions documented at adoption. The health guarantee covers veterinary costs up to the adoption fee amount only and requires Adopter to use a Forever Friends-approved veterinarian for the initial visit. Use of a non-approved veterinarian within the first 30 days voids the health guarantee.\n\n2. HOME ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nAdopter certifies that all members of the household have been informed of and consent to the adoption. If Adopter rents, Adopter must provide written landlord approval before the animal may be released. Adopter agrees to keep the animal indoors (cats) or in a securely fenced yard (dogs) at all times. Dogs may not be tethered outdoors as a primary containment method. Adopter agrees to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, and socialization appropriate to the species. Failure to meet these requirements constitutes a breach of contract and grounds for animal recovery.\n\n3. HOME VISITS AND INSPECTIONS\n\nAdopter grants Forever Friends the right to conduct a pre-adoption home inspection and follow-up post-adoption home visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months. Additional visits may be conducted at any time if Forever Friends receives a concern about the animal's welfare, from any source. Inspections will be scheduled with at least 24 hours' notice when possible, but Forever Friends reserves the right to conduct unannounced welfare checks if it has reasonable cause for concern, as determined solely by Forever Friends. Refusal to allow a home visit is grounds for animal recovery.\n\n4. TRANSFER, REHOMING, AND RETURN POLICY\n\nAdopter may NOT sell, give away, or transfer the animal to any third party under any circumstances. If Adopter can no longer care for the animal at any point during the animal's lifetime, Adopter MUST return the animal to Forever Friends. No refund of adoption fees will be issued upon return. If the animal is found in the possession of anyone other than the Adopter without prior written approval, Forever Friends may recover the animal immediately and pursue legal action for breach of contract. Adopter is responsible for all costs associated with recovery, including attorney fees.\n\n5. BREEDING PROHIBITION AND MEDICAL DECISIONS\n\nThe adopted animal may not be bred under any circumstances. If the animal has not been spayed/neutered at the time of adoption, Adopter agrees to complete the surgery within 30 days or by 6 months of age, whichever comes later, using a Forever Friends-approved veterinarian. Failure to provide proof of spay/neuter by the deadline results in forfeiture of the $150 spay/neuter deposit and is grounds for animal recovery. Adopter may not have the animal declawed, devocalized, or subjected to any cosmetic surgical procedure. Euthanasia decisions require prior consultation with Forever Friends unless a licensed veterinarian certifies the animal is in acute, untreatable suffering.\n\n6. MICROCHIP AND LIFETIME TRACKING\n\nThe microchip registered to the adopted animal shall remain registered to Forever Friends as the secondary contact in perpetuity. Adopter agrees to keep registration information current, including address and phone number, and to notify Forever Friends within 7 days of any change of address. Failure to maintain current registration is a breach of this contract. Forever Friends retains the right to contact the Adopter at any time to inquire about the animal's welfare.
