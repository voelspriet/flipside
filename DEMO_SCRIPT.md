## The Script

### SCENE 1 — The Hook (0:00–0:25)

**Screen**: Black screen or title card.

**Narration**:
> "I'm Henk van Ess. I've spent 20 years teaching journalists how to find what's hidden in plain sight. Last year I published a peer-reviewed method called 'Think Like a Document' — don't read from your perspective, read from the source's perspective.
>
> Then I thought: what if I applied that to the documents we all sign? The ones we don't read. The ones written by someone else's lawyer."

**Action**: Title card fades. FlipSide landing page appears.

---

### SCENE 2 — The Upload (0:25–0:45)

**Screen**: FlipSide upload screen with the 14 sample tiles visible.

**Narration**:
> "FlipSide works on anything someone else wrote for you to sign. A lease. An insurance policy. A gym membership. Even sweepstakes rules.
>
> I don't write code. Every line of this was built through conversation with Claude Opus 4.6 in one weekend. Let me show you what it does."

**Action**: Click **"My New Place"** (lease tile). The sidebar fills with document text. The loading state shows "Everything looks standard... until you flip it."

---

### SCENE 3 — The First Card (0:45–1:15)

**Screen**: First flip card appears. Green header. Reassurance headline. Reader voice.

**Narration**:
> "Cards appear within seconds. This is what a trusting reader sees. The green header, the reassuring language. 'Your flexible payment timeline.' And here — the reader's voice. What you'd actually think reading this clause for the first time."

**Action**: Let the card sit for 3 seconds. Read the "I'd think" text aloud or let the audience read it.

> "Sounds fine, right? Now..."

**Action**: Click **"Now flip it ↻"**. Pause. Let the flip animation complete. The sidebar dims.

**Narration** (slower, after the flip):
> "The back of the card. What the drafter intended. Red. Score 85. Trick: Cascade Clause. And the number that matters — in bold."

**Action**: Point to the figure (e.g. "$4,100 in penalties if you're two days late"). Let it sit for 2 seconds.

> "That's the same clause. Same words. Two completely different readings."

---

### SCENE 4 — Browse More Cards (1:15–1:40)

**Screen**: Navigate through 2-3 more cards. Show one flip.

**Narration**:
> "Every clause gets the same treatment. The front is how the drafter wants you to feel. The back is what an expert catches. Green means fair. Yellow means notable. Red means strategically asymmetric — written to benefit one side."

**Action**: Navigate to a yellow card (show it's not all red — the tool is calibrated). Flip it. Then navigate to a green card briefly.

> "And notice — not everything is red. FlipSide flags what's actually unfair, not everything."

---

### SCENE 5 — The Expert Verdict (1:40–2:10)

**Screen**: The verdict column on the right. Sections turning green.

**Narration**:
> "While you're browsing cards, four Opus 4.6 threads are building the expert verdict in parallel. Cross-clause interactions — risks you can't see reading one clause at a time. Power asymmetry — who has the obligations, who has the exits. Document archaeology — which clauses are boilerplate and which were custom-drafted. And an overall assessment where Opus actually reviews its own analysis for blind spots."

**Action**: Click on a completed (green) section to open the focused reading panel. Scroll briefly. Show the ←→ navigation. Click "← Back" to return.

> "Each section appears as it completes. Click to read. Navigate between them. When all four are done — the full verdict is ready."

---

### SCENE 6 — Take Action (2:10–2:40)

**Screen**: Click "Read full verdict →". Show the deep analysis briefly. Then scroll to the action buttons.

**Narration**:
> "But FlipSide doesn't stop at analysis. You can ask follow-up questions — 'What happens if I'm three months late on rent?' And Opus traces the answer through every relevant clause."

**Action**: (If time allows, type a quick follow-up question and show streaming response. Otherwise, just point to the button.)

> "Or — message the company."

**Action**: Click "Message the Company" (or "Draft a message"). Show the letter streaming in.

> "One click. A professional letter citing the specific clauses. Copy it. Email it. You don't need a lawyer to ask the right questions — you just need to see what the other side wrote."

---

### SCENE 7 — The Close (2:40–3:00)

**Screen**: Return to the upload screen. Show the 14 sample tiles.

**Narration**:
> "I built this because I believe everyone deserves to see the other side of what they sign. Not just people who can afford a lawyer. Everyone.
>
> FlipSide. The dark side of small print."

**Action**: Hold on the landing page for 2 seconds. Cut to black or title card with:
- **FlipSide**
- **The dark side of small print.**
- **Built with Claude Opus 4.6**

## Tips

- **The flip is the money shot.** Don't rush it. Let the card sit on the front for 3 seconds. Let the audience read the "I'd think" text. Then flip. Silence during the animation is more powerful than narration.
- **Use the lease**, not insurance. Everyone has signed a lease. The late fee cascade is viscerally relatable. "$4,100 in penalties if you're two days late" is the kind of number that makes people gasp.
- **Show green cards.** A tool that says everything is dangerous loses credibility. When you show a green card ("Confirmed: fair as written"), it proves the tool is calibrated.
- **The "I don't write code" line** is your differentiator. You're not a developer demoing a tech project. You're a journalist who built something people need — using Claude as the builder. That story is the hackathon story.
- **Don't demo the countdown timer or tricks panel.** They fill wait time in live use but slow down a scripted video. The edit can skip the 12-second wait entirely.
- **One take is fine.** Loom records screen + voice together. You can do multiple takes and pick the best one. The judges want authenticity, not production value.
