## The Script

### SCENE 1 — The Hook (0:00–0:25)

**Screen**: Black screen or title card.

**Narration**:
> "I'm Henk van Ess. I've spent 20 years teaching journalists how to find what's hidden in plain sight. Last year I published a peer-reviewed method called 'Think Like a Document' — don't read from your perspective, read from the source's perspective.
>
> Then I thought: what if I applied that to the documents we all sign? The ones we don't read. The ones written by someone else's lawyer."

**Action**: Title card fades. FlipSide landing page appears.

---

### SCENE 2 — The Upload (0:25–0:45)

**Screen**: FlipSide upload screen with the 14 sample tiles visible.

**Narration**:
> "FlipSide works on anything someone else wrote for you to sign. A lease. An insurance policy. A gym membership. Even sweepstakes rules.
>
> I don't write code. Every line of this was built through conversation with Claude Opus 4.6 in one weekend. Let me show you what it does."

**Action**: Click **"My New Place"** (lease tile). The sidebar fills with document text. The loading state shows "Everything looks standard... until you flip it."

---

### SCENE 3 — The First Card (0:45–1:15)

**Screen**: First flip card appears. Green header. Reassurance headline. Reader voice.

**Narration**:
> "Cards appear within seconds. This is what a trusting reader sees. The green header, the reassuring language. 'Your flexible payment timeline.' And here — the reader's voice. What you'd actually think reading this clause for the first time."

**Action**: Let the card sit for 3 seconds. Read the "I'd think" text aloud or let the audience read it.

> "Sounds fine, right? Now..."

**Action**: Click **"Now flip it ↻"**. Pause. Let the flip animation complete. The sidebar dims.

**Narration** (slower, after the flip):
> "The back of the card. What the drafter intended. Red. Score 85. Trick: Cascade Clause. And the number that matters — in bold."

**Action**: Point to the figure (e.g. "$4,100 in penalties if you're two days late"). Let it sit for 2 seconds.

> "That's the same clause. Same words. Two completely different readings."

---

### SCENE 4 — Browse More Cards (1:15–1:40)

**Screen**: Navigate through 2-3 more cards. Show one flip.

**Narration**:
> "Every clause gets the same treatment. The front is how the drafter wants you to feel. The back is what an expert catches. Green means fair. Yellow means notable. Red means strategically asymmetric — written to benefit one side."

**Action**: Navigate to a yellow card (show it's not all red — the tool is calibrated). Flip it. Then navigate to a green card briefly.

> "And notice — not everything is red. FlipSide flags what's actually unfair, not everything."

---

### SCENE 5 — The Expert Verdict (1:40–2:05)

**Screen**: Scroll to the inline verdict below the cards.

**Narration**:
> "While you browse cards, Opus 4.6 builds the expert verdict. One screen: verdict tier, the main risk, power ratio — their rights vs. yours — and jurisdiction. Everything a lawyer would tell you, in thirty seconds."

**Action**: Scroll through the verdict briefly. Point to the tier badge, the power ratio, the "one action." Then point to the Go Deeper buttons.

> "And if you want more — four on-demand deep dives. Click one, Opus analyzes on the spot."

**Action**: Click "Walk-Away Number." Show the pulsing dots → then the hero number streaming in (e.g., "$23,450").

> "Your maximum financial exposure. One click."

---

### SCENE 6 — Ask FlipSide: The Agent Moment (2:05–2:40)

**Screen**: Scroll to the "Ask a follow-up question" input below the verdict.

**Narration**:
> "Now here's where Opus 4.6 really shines. I can ask it anything about this lease — and watch it work."

**Action**: Type: **"What happens if I'm 3 months late on rent?"** — press Enter.

**Narration** (while the agent runs — read what appears on screen):
> "Watch. It's searching the document... found the late fee clause and the termination clause. Now it's pulling up its own prior analysis of those clauses..."

**Action**: Let the tool call indicators appear on screen:
- 🔍 Searching document for "late payment"...
- 📄 Reading clause analysis #1...
- 📄 Reading clause analysis #4...
Then the answer streams in with the $12,300 breakdown table.

**Narration** (after answer appears):
> "Twelve thousand three hundred dollars. The late fees alone exceed the unpaid rent. That's not a generic AI answer — Opus searched the document, retrieved its own analysis, and did the math. Three tool calls, one answer. That's an agent."

**Action**: Let the answer sit for 2-3 seconds so judges can read the table.

---

### SCENE 7 — The Close (2:40–3:00)

**Screen**: Return to the upload screen. Show the 14 sample tiles.

**Narration**:
> "I built this because I believe everyone deserves to see the other side of what they sign. Not just people who can afford a lawyer. Everyone.
>
> FlipSide. The dark side of small print."

**Action**: Hold on the landing page for 2 seconds. Cut to black or title card with:
- **FlipSide**
- **The dark side of small print.**
- **Built with Claude Opus 4.6**

## Tips

- **The flip is the money shot #1.** Don't rush it. Let the card sit on the front for 3 seconds. Let the audience read the "I'd think" text. Then flip. Silence during the animation is more powerful than narration.
- **The agent is money shot #2.** When the tool calls appear ("Searching document..." → "Reading clause analysis..."), let them breathe. The judges need to SEE that Opus is using tools autonomously, not just generating text. The $12,300 answer with the breakdown table is the payoff.
- **Use the lease**, not insurance. Everyone has signed a lease. The late fee cascade is viscerally relatable. "$12,300 in total exposure" is the kind of number that makes people gasp.
- **Show green cards.** A tool that says everything is dangerous loses credibility. When you show a green card ("Confirmed: fair as written"), it proves the tool is calibrated.
- **The "I don't write code" line** is your differentiator. You're not a developer demoing a tech project. You're a journalist who built something people need — using Claude as the builder. That story is the hackathon story.
- **Don't demo the countdown timer or tricks panel.** They fill wait time in live use but slow down a scripted video. The edit can skip the 12-second wait entirely.
- **Pre-run the analysis before recording.** Start recording AFTER the lease is already analyzed (cards + verdict visible). This saves 15-20 seconds of dead time. You can show the upload screen at the beginning for context, then cut to the already-analyzed lease.
- **Pre-type the question.** Have "What happens if I'm 3 months late on rent?" ready to paste or pre-typed. Don't waste video time on typing.
- **One take is fine.** Loom records screen + voice together. You can do multiple takes and pick the best one. The judges want authenticity, not production value.
