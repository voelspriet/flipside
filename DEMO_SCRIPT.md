# FlipSide Demo Video — 3-Minute Script

## Recording Setup

- **Tool**: Loom (voice + screen in one take) or QuickTime + voiceover
- **Browser**: Chrome or Safari, full-screen, no bookmarks bar
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5001`
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 2560x1440
- **Prep**: Have the lease sample pre-analyzed (cards + verdict loaded) for the main demo. Record the upload + loading screen separately and splice in — this avoids dead time while keeping the Expert Mind moment.
- **Pace**: Unhurried. Let the product breathe. Silence during the flip is more powerful than narration.

## The Script

### SCENE 1 — The Hook (0:00–0:20)

**Screen**: Black screen or title card.

**Narration**:
> "I'm Henk van Ess. I've spent 20 years teaching journalists to find what's hidden in plain sight. I published a peer-reviewed method called 'Think Like a Document' — don't read from your perspective, read from the source's.
>
> What if I applied that to the documents we all sign but never read?"

**Action**: Title card fades. FlipSide landing page appears — 14 sample tiles visible.

---

### SCENE 2 — The Upload + Expert Mind (0:20–0:45)

**Screen**: FlipSide upload screen.

**Narration**:
> "FlipSide works on anything someone else wrote for you to sign. Leases. Insurance. Gym memberships. Sweepstakes rules.
>
> I don't write code. Every line — all fourteen thousand of them — was built through conversation with Claude Opus 4.6 in one weekend. Let me show you."

**Action**: Click **"My New Place"** (lease tile). The loading screen appears: document text scrolling in the preview, clause markers lighting up as Haiku scans.

> "Watch the loading screen. Opus 4.6 is reading the document right now — and narrating what it finds as it thinks."

**Action**: Hold on the Expert Mind briefing for 3-4 seconds. The narrated sentences appear one by one ("Scanning for hidden cascading penalties..." etc.) — this is Opus 4.6 thinking in real time. Then the cards whoosh in.

---

### SCENE 3 — The First Flip (0:45–1:15)

**Screen**: First flip card. Green header. Reassurance headline. Reader voice below.

**Narration**:
> "Cards appear in eight seconds. This is what a trusting reader sees. Green header. Reassuring language. And the reader's voice — what you'd actually think the first time you read this."

**Action**: Let the card sit for 3 seconds. Let the audience read the gullible reader's "I'd think..." text.

> "Sounds fine, right?"

**Action**: Click **"See what this really means ›"**. Pause. Let the flip complete. The sidebar dims to 35%.

**Narration** (slower, after the flip):
> "Same clause. Same words. Score 85. Trick: Cascade Clause. And the number that matters..."

**Action**: Point to the bold figure (e.g. "$4,100 in penalties if you're two days late"). Hold for 2 seconds.

> "Two completely different readings. That's the flip."

---

### SCENE 4 — Browse Cards + Progress Strip (1:15–1:40)

**Screen**: Card navigation. The verdict progress strip glows below the nav: "Expert verdict building..."

**Narration**:
> "Every clause gets this treatment. Green means genuinely fair. Yellow, notable. Red — strategically asymmetric, written to benefit one side."

**Action**: Navigate to a **green** card. Show it's not all red — the tool is calibrated.

> "Not everything is a trap. When a clause is fair, FlipSide says so. That's how you know the red ones are real."

**Action**: Point briefly to the progress strip showing "Expert verdict building..." with dots filling as Opus works. Then navigate to a yellow card, flip it.

---

### SCENE 5 — The One-Screen Verdict (1:40–2:05)

**Screen**: The progress strip transforms: **"Your Expert Verdict is Ready — Read it >"**. Click it.

**Narration**:
> "While you browse cards, Opus 4.6 builds an expert verdict in the background. One screen — everything a lawyer would tell you in thirty seconds."

**Action**: Scroll through the verdict. Point to each section:
- **Verdict tier badge** (e.g. "Review Carefully" in yellow/red)
- **The Main Thing** — one paragraph, the worst risk, bold number
- **Power ratio** — their rights vs. your rights, counted from the document
- **Jurisdiction** — auto-detected, local law violations flagged

> "Verdict tier. Main risk. Power ratio. Jurisdiction. And four Go Deeper buttons powered by Opus 4.6."

**Action**: Click **"Walk-Away Number"**. Show the pulsing dots, then the hero number streaming in (e.g. **"$23,450"**).

> "Your maximum financial exposure. One click."

---

### SCENE 6 — Ask FlipSide: The Agent (2:05–2:40)

**Screen**: The follow-up question input below the verdict.

**Narration**:
> "Now — Opus 4.6 as an agent. I can ask anything about this lease and watch it work."

**Action**: Paste or type: **"What happens if I'm 3 months late on rent?"** — press Enter.

**Narration** (as tool calls appear on screen):
> "It's searching the document... found the late fee clause. Now reading its own analysis of clause four..."

**Action**: Let the tool call indicators breathe on screen:
- `🔍 Searching document for "late payment"...`
- `📄 Reading clause analysis #1...`
- `📄 Reading clause analysis #4...`

Then the answer streams in with a dollar breakdown.

**Narration** (after answer appears):
> "Twelve thousand three hundred dollars. The late fees exceed the unpaid rent. That's not a generic AI answer — Opus searched the document, pulled its own prior analysis, and did the math. Three tool calls, one answer. That's an agent."

**Action**: Hold for 2 seconds so judges can read the breakdown.

---

### SCENE 7 — The Close (2:40–3:00)

**Screen**: Scroll back up or return to the upload screen. The 14 sample tiles.

**Narration**:
> "Eighty-six commits. One weekend. Zero coding experience. Built entirely through conversation with Claude Opus 4.6.
>
> I built this because everyone deserves to see the other side of what they sign. Not just people who can afford a lawyer. Everyone.
>
> FlipSide. The dark side of small print."

**Action**: Hold on the landing page for 2 seconds. Cut to black or title card:
- **FlipSide**
- **The dark side of small print.**
- **Built with Claude Opus 4.6**

## What Judges See (Scoring Rubric)

|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Demo Quality (30%)** | Scenes 3-6: flip card mechanic, Expert Mind loading, verdict, agent tool calls — all live, all streaming |

## Tips

- **The flip is money shot #1.** Don't rush it. Let the card sit on the front for 3 full seconds. Let the audience read the gullible reader's "I'd think" text. Then flip. Silence during the animation is more powerful than narration.
- **The agent is money shot #2.** When the tool calls appear ("Searching document..." → "Reading clause analysis..."), let them breathe. The judges need to SEE that Opus is using tools autonomously, not just generating text. The dollar answer with the breakdown is the payoff.
- **The Expert Mind loading screen is your Opus 4.6 showcase.** It's the only moment in the video where judges SEE the model thinking. Don't skip it — but don't linger more than 4 seconds.
- **Use the lease**, not insurance. Everyone has signed a lease. Late fee cascades are viscerally relatable. "$12,300 in total exposure" makes people gasp.
- **Show a green card.** A tool that flags everything loses credibility. One green card ("Confirmed: fair as written") proves calibration.
- **The "I don't write code" line** is your differentiator. You're a journalist who built 14,000 lines through conversation with Claude. That story IS the hackathon story.
- **Pre-run the analysis** before recording. Start recording AFTER the lease is already analyzed. Show the upload screen first for context, then cut to the loaded analysis. Record the Expert Mind loading screen in a separate take and splice it in.
- **Pre-type the question.** Have "What happens if I'm 3 months late on rent?" ready to paste. Don't waste video time on typing.
- **One take is fine.** Loom records screen + voice together. The judges want authenticity, not production value.
- **Don't demo**: countdown timer, tricks panel, dark mode toggle, keyboard shortcuts, session history. They fill wait time in live use but slow down a scripted video.
